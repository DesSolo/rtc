# 🚀 RTC - Real-time Configuration Management

Welcome to RTC, your solution for dynamic and efficient configuration management! 🎉

RTC provides a robust platform to manage your application configurations in real-time, allowing for seamless updates and deployments without service interruptions.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dynamic Configuration Updates:** Modify configurations on the fly and have your applications react instantly.
- **Centralized Management:** A single source of truth for all your application settings across different environments.
- **Environment-Specific Configurations:** Easily manage configurations tailored for development, staging, and production environments.
- **Version Control for Configurations:** Track changes to your configurations, revert to previous versions, and maintain an audit trail.
- **User Management & Audit Logs:** Securely manage users and monitor all configuration changes with detailed audit logs.

## ⚠️ Important Note on Configuration Size

Currently, each configuration is limited to **128 keys**. This limitation is due to the underlying `etcd` storage. We are actively exploring solutions to overcome this, but for now, please keep your configurations concise.

We hope you enjoy using RTC! If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out. 🌟
